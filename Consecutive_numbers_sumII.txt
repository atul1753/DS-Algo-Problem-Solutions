# Consecutive Numbers Sum -> https://leetcode.com/problems/consecutive-numbers-sum/
# For consecutive numbers, N=(x+1)+(x+2)+....(x+k)
# N=xk+(k(k+1)/2), therefore xk=N-(k(k+1)/2), so for all k if(N-(k(k+1)/2)%k==0, this means that this is one solution.

    int consecutiveNumbersSum(int N) {
        int count = 1;

        }
        return count;
